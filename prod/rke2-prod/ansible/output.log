nohup: ignoring input
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected '-' indicator

The error appears to be in '/home/ansible/rke/rke2-dev/ansible/playbook.yaml': line 68, column 5, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    roles:
    ^ here
